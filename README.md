# oak

Oak is a proof checker focused on simplicity, readability, and ease of use.

For downloads and more information, including a tutorial, go to [oakproof.org](http://oakproof.org/).

## Requirements

  * [Ruby programming language](http://ruby-lang.org/)
  * [E theorem prover](http://eprover.org/) version â‰¥ 2.0.  E is included in the prepackaged Oak downloads available at [oakproof.org](http://oakproof.org/).  If you prefer to install E yourself, be sure to add E's PROVER directory to your system's PATH variable so that Oak will detect it.
  
## Usage

```bash
oak [-v] [filename]
    -v  print the version number of Oak
```

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to Stephan Schulz, the author of E, for answering questions and adding options to E to better support Oak.
